# WARMUP - front

## Introduction
Warmup is a project made during my training as part of the web developper formation at Wild Code School Bordeaux. The point was to test all the knowledges and skills I've learned for the past 5 months. I had to create a complete project (front-back-database) in 48h. This project is made with React for the front, Node.js Express for the back and the database is made with mySQL. 
I decided to create an application that could help me while practicing bass guitar. I could create my own exercises by uploading youtube videos. The application could monitoring the time I spent exercising.

### This is the repository for the front-end part of Warmup.

All files illustrating the research for the conception are located in the folder `DB` in the back part, and in the folder `public/assets` in the front part.

## If you want to run the project localy, you can follow these steps :

  * Clone the project.

  * Navigate at the project root and run `npm install`.

  * Recreate a `.env` file and enter yours environment variables.

  * The database can be easily integrated in an SQL environment with the file `create-db.sql` located in the folder `DB` in the back part.

  * A file `populate_db.sql` located in the folder `DB` in the back part allows you to fill the database with mock test datas. Only the first `INSERT INTO` is required. For a better experience, it is best to create your own account while the application is running.

  * Run `npm start` in the back project to launch the API.

  * Run `npm start` in the front project to launch the application.
